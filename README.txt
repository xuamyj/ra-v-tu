- move, obviously
  * can pass by friend, but can't stand on friend, remove friends AFTER the recursion
- decide who to heal, and do it. 
  * i guess i do need items bc malcolm doesn't have a way to heal himself ?? or should i just let him heal himself <- the latter
- decide who to fight, and do it. when fighting, need to do that big calculation. ALSO how to adjust for "luck" stat <- treat as if 5. ALSO should we readjust the stats now? 
  * add weapons triangle - this one is actually already built in

- forts add defense and healing
- gain exp
- gain supports 
---- 
- dialogue mid-battle, like needing to retreat
- enemies can move and initiate fight
- Optional: map looks prettier for move

Things not done (at all?): 

- crit
- items to heal (or do anything else)
- change weapons, or upgrade weapon levels
- skills of any kind
- upgrade class 
- get horse / wyvern
- recruit someone in the middle
