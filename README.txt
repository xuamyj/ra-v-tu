Things for later:
- i think this is a apply/bind/call error but am too sleepy to dig into that, teach me please

- remember to print enemy stats
- move, obviously
- when checking healing, need to make sure hp is not full
- when fighting, need to do that big calculation. ALSO how to adjust for "luck" stat, ALSO should we readjust the stats now? 

- add weapons triangle
- gain exp
- gain supports 
---- 
- dialogue mid-battle, like needing to retreat
- enemies can move and initiate fight
