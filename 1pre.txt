A: We're back from patrol. Leonidas and I spotted some bandits gathering not too far from here.

L: About a dozen men. Armed. Looked planning something.

M: Did they see you? Are they following?

A: No, I don't think so. We kept our distance and watched from hiding.

F: What do you think their plans are? Could be trouble for travelers on the road.

M: Best we-

BanditLeader: Well well, what do we have here? A couple of merchants and their guards? You shouldn't be out here all alone.

Henchman: We could help you out... for a price! Hand over all your goods and no one gets hurt.

A: I'm afraid we won't be doing that. You'll have to go find loot elsewhere.

BanditLeader: Wrong answer! Boys, take care of them. Leave nothing behind!

L: We fight now. No choice. Stay close, help each other. We stop them here!
