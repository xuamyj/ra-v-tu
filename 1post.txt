A: Everyone alright? No major injuries? 

L: Just scratches. We fought well together. 

M: Let me tend to those wounds, just in case. 

F: Wait, over there... isn't that a horse tied by those trees? 

A: You're right, I see it now. Think it belongs to those bandits?

M: Allow me a closer look. Hmm... there seems to be magic surrounding this creature. I sense no ill will, but there's mystery here.  

L: Could be a trap. The bandits are gone now, but others may come.

F: The poor thing looks scared. I say we free it, see what happens.

A: I agree. No need to leave it here alone. Foteini, would you like to untie it? 

F: Yes... there we go. 

M: Fascinating. It appears unafraid now. Shall we continue our journey and see if it chooses to join us?

L: Stay close, watch for trouble. But yes, let's be on our way.
